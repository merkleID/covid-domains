# covid-domains

DNS domains-blacklist to use with BIND, Unbound, dnsmasq.

It's up to the dns-admin to properly install those lists and configure his own dns resolver.

File 0.0.0.0-domains is for general purpose, usually Unbound

File full-domains-list.txt can be used with Pi-Hole.

File source-domains.txt is the original file as I fetch it on which I do cat, awk, cut.
