# Covid-related malware/spam domains list

COVID19/coronavirus malware/spam domains dns-blacklist to use with BIND, Unbound, dnsmasq.

It's up to the dns-admin to properly install those lists and configure his own dns resolver.

File 0.0.0.0-domains.txt is for general purpose, usually Unbound.

File full-domains-list.txt can be used with Pi-Hole just by adding


https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merkleID/covid-domains/master/full-domains-list.txt


to /etc/pihole/adlist.list
